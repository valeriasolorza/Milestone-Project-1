Milestone Project 1 -  Browser Game

This is a Simon Says game 

In the Simon Says web game, players are presented with a sequence of colored buttons that light up in a specific order. The goal of the game is to replicate this sequence by clicking on the buttons in the same order. Here are the basic rules:

1. Start: The game begins with a sequence of one color being displayed.
2. Display Sequence: The colors in the sequence are shown one at a time, lighting up in a specific order.
3. Player's Turn: After the sequence is displayed, it's the player's turn to replicate it.
4. User Input: The player clicks on the buttons in the same order as the sequence they just saw.
5. Check Input: After the player completes their sequence, the game checks if it matches the original sequence.
6. Correct Sequence: If the player's sequence matches the original one, they proceed to the next round with an extended sequence.
7. Incorrect Sequence: If the player makes a mistake and their sequence doesn't match, the game ends.
8. Scoring: The player earns points for each correct sequence replicated.
9. Restart: After the game ends, players can choose to restart and play again.
The game becomes progressively challenging as the sequences get longer. Players need to remember and replicate the increasingly complex sequences to earn higher scores.
